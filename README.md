To tag everyone on a Facebook Page, simply create a post or comment, type the "@" symbol, and start typing the first few letters of the Page's name. A drop-down menu will appear, allowing you to select the Page. This tags everyone associated with the Page. Ensure the Page's settings allow tagging to include all members.
